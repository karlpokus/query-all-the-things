# query-all-the-things
One query for all the docs - including gists and google as default fallback.

# Demo
[demo](http://codepen.io/KarlPokus/debug/YGXLjb)

# wat?
How is this any better than the gists search at github I hear you ask. Well, maybe not - but you get the convenience of only searching once for multiple sources *and* filter search by username by default *and* you get a handy list of results unlike githubs gists UI with huge thumbnails. You decide.

# TODOs
- [x] navigate results by arrows
- [x] google with search term
- [ ] this would ideally be a chrome extension that displays relevant gists next to google search results
- [ ] store user in localstorage on first query
- [ ] use Etag
- [ ] filter by multiple query strings
- [ ] Maybe use [SO search api](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/advanced-search)
